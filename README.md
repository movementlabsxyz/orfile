## Organization

There are five subdirectories which progressively build on one another for node logic.

1. [`util`](./util): contains utility logic mainly reused in [`protocol`](./protocol).
2. [`protocol`](./protocol): contains implementations of the protocol logic.
3. [`node`](./node): contains single-process runnable binaries that aggregate the protocol logic.
4. [`network`](./network): contains logic for running multiple nodes in a network.
5. [`sdk`](./sdk): contains logic for interacting nodes and networks.

There are several other subdirectories of note:

- [`spec`](./spec): contains formal verification of FFS protocols.

### Crates

To better understand the available crates we recommend reviewing the `cargo doc` documentation:

```bash
cargo doc --open --no-deps
```

### Production

Coming soon!
